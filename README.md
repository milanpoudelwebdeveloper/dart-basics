# dart-basics

"Dart-basics" is just a reference for learning. Myself as a Javascript Developer, I find most of the things in Dart very similar to Javascript programming language.

The repository and examples contains all basics of Dart and features of Dart. You can run all programs in your Editor, likewise there are some errors in the code that are intentional 
just to find out the differences between different variable types used. 

This can be used as a reference for basic learning of Dart by any beginners.
